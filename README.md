# PhoneNowAnalysis

INTRODUCTION

The PhoneNow Call Center Project is the first project I worked on for my internship with PwC Switzerland on Forage Platform. This project was carried out to derive trends on customer satisfaction and call agentsâ€™ performance.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Claire, the call center manager at PhoneNow sent a mail requesting that I create a visualization dashboard on the call center trends showing transparency and insights into the dataset gathered in the first quarter of the year 2021. This dashboard will be used as a basis for discussion with the management.
Here is the [link](https://medium.com/@olabisiolaleye/phonenow-call-center-trends-78dd271f9a20) the data storytelling of the project.
